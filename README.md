# GithubTrending iOS app
Project assignment for iOS developer position

## Architecture
**MVVM** with **Coordinators** in combination with reactive programming using RxSwift

### Pros:
- Scalability, testability, modularity, declarative approach
- Future of iOS programming (SwiftUI, Combine)
### Cons:
- Learning curve, overusing leads to hard debugging

## What could be improved
 - Missing error handlings
 - More user friendly empty states (Empty tableviews, empty texts)
 - UI (asssets weren't provided, only png of the screens)
 - Consider using proper persistance CoreData/Realm
 - Unit/UI tests
 - Swiftgen for assets(localization strings, images)
 - Dependency injection library
 - ipad optimalizations

## Final words
- This should serve as a showcase of my general coding style and architectural selection... not as an example of production ready pixel perfect app.
